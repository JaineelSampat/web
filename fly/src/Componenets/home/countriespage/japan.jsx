          Japan is an island nation located in East Asia, consisting of four main
          islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, along with numerous
          smaller islands. It is situated in the Pacific Ocean and is bordered by
          the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. Japan is

          earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons due to its location along the
          Pacific Ring of Fire.
