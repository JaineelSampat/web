        Japan is an island nation located in East Asia, consisting of four main
        islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku, along with numerous
        smaller islands. It is situated in the Pacific Ocean and is bordered by
        the Sea of Japan to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. Japan is
        known for its diverse geography, including mountainous regions like the
        Japanese Alps, volcanic landscapes such as Mount Fuji, fertile plains
        like the Kanto Plain, and extensive coastlines. The country is prone to
        earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons due to its location along the
        Pacific Ring of Fire.

        Japanese architecture reflects a unique blend of traditional and modern
        influences, characterized by simplicity, harmony with nature, and
        attention to detail. Traditional Japanese architecture features wooden
        structures with sliding doors, tatami mat flooring, and minimalist
        design principles. Iconic examples include shrines and temples such as
        Kyoto's Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) and Tokyo's Senso-ji Temple.
        Japanese gardens, with their meticulous landscaping, ponds, and stone
        arrangements, are integral to Japanese architecture and culture. In
        modern Japan, innovative architectural designs can be found in urban
        centers like Tokyo and Osaka, with skyscrapers, contemporary museums,
        and avant-garde structures showcasing cutting-edge architectural trends.
