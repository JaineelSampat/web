          The culture of the United States is incredibly diverse, reflecting its
          history of immigration and multiculturalism. It is often described as
          a "melting pot" where people from various ethnic, religious, and
          cultural backgrounds contribute to a rich tapestry of traditions,
          languages, and customs. American culture has had a profound global
          influence, particularly in areas such as music, film, literature, and
          technology. The concept of the "American Dream," representing the
          pursuit of opportunity, freedom, and success, is deeply ingrained in
          the national ethos
